# Personal Projects

This repository contains personal projects aimed at enhancing my coding skills. The projects cover various areas, including coding games, calculators, data visualization, and machine learning. Each project features a preliminary paragraph that summarizes its premise and background information. 

## Games
- <b>Which Strange Animal Are You Quiz</b> - Jupyter Notebook / I created a short, fun, little quiz that asks 10 questions and determines which strange animal you are most likely to be at the end.

## Machine Learning
- <b>Free Code Camp Machine Learning Course</b> - Jupyter Notebook / To enhance my knowledge and skills in machine learning, I took this ~4 hour <a href="https://youtu.be/i_LwzRVP7bg?si=dReaZuURxMfo4YCm">"Machine Learning for Everybody - Full Course"</a> video taught by Kylie Ying and posted on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel.

- <b>ML Practice</b> - These projects are just me practicing with different machine learning algorithms. The projects I used are credited in the file.

## Math
- <b>Find Your Weight on Other Planets of the Solar System</b> - Jupyter Notebook / I made a calculator that takes your weight in lbs or kg as input and outputs your weight on other planets
