    "\n",
    "- (A) Ignore and keep on walking\n",
    "- (B) Fight the bully\n",
    "- (C) Join the bully\n",
    "- (D) Report the situation to a teacher and walk away\n",
    "\n",
    "Then based on the animal's given characteristics (once again, subjective), then they will be given points for that answer choice. So if the user chose \"(B) fight the bully\", then Sparklemuffin and Blind Cavefish would get a point added. By the end of the game, the animal with the most points will be the winner. In the case of a tie...I'll work that out later."
